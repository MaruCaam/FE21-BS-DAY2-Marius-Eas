              <h5 class="card-title">Carrie-Anne Moss</h5>
              <p class="card-text"> Carrie-Anne Moss was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice which was produced in Barcelona for its first season. She followed the series to its new shooting location in Los Angeles the next year. Once in LA she began getting more opportunities, one of which was a TV series Matrix (which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous), another was being cast as a series regular for Aaron Spelling's television spectacle Models Inc.

                Carrie-Anne's work was already gaining traction throughout the motion picture casting community when the late great casting director Mali Finn invited Carrie-Anne to audition for The Wachowski's and their top secret sci-fi action project; that activated her explosive film career. The writer/directors recognized Carrie-Anne's empowered yet openhearted leading qualities and following a challenging process of physical and character screen tests they ultimately gave her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior "Trinity" in the record breaking, award winning and internationally successful The Matrix trilogy for Warner Bros/Village Roadshow. Her extraordinary performance launched her on to the world stage alongside her "One" Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history as the first woman to triumphantly fight her way through one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.</p>
