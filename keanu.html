              <h5 class="card-title">Keanu Reeves</h5>
              <p class="card-text">At age 9, he started his acting career by appearing onstage, and at age 14, he appeared in Canadian television series and commercials. He also appeared in short movies and stage work in early 1980s. Keanu acted his first significant role in River's Edge (1987), and the next year (1988), he appeared in some movies such as Dangerous Liaisons and Permanent Record. </p>
              <p>Canadian actor Keanu Reeves enjoyed a protean film career that encompassed broad comedies like "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1988), action blockbusters like "Speed" (1994), "The Matrix" (1999) and "John Wick" (2015) and arthouse projects like "My Own Private Idaho" (1990) over the course of several decades. Born Keanu Charles Reeves on September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon, he was the son of Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr., an American of Chinese-Hawaiian, English, Irish and Portuguese descent, and Patricia Taylor, who hailed from England. His parents separated when Reeves was three years of age, and Taylor, who worked as a costume designer, took their son with her on various assignments in Sydney, Australia and New York City before settling in Toronto, Ontario. There, Reeves' mother would marry and divorce three more husbands, while her son, raised primarily by grandparents and nannies, cycled through several Toronto high schools while nurturing an interest in hockey. But roles in theater productions convinced him to pursue a career as an actor, and he soon logged appearances in local television commercials and episodic series. After making his feature film debut as a Quebecois goalie in the Rob Lowe hockey drama, "Youngblood" (1986), Reeves headed south to Los Angeles, where he found steady work in various American TV-movies and episodic programs. But after earning solid notices for a dramatic turn as a thoughtful teenager caught up in a murder in Tim Hunter's "The River's Edge" (1986), Reeves graduated to features, where his quiet intensity and exotic good looks initially minted him as a romantic juvenile lead or bruised antihero in films like "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988) and "Permanent Record" (1988). But he showed an unexpected knack for comedy with his turn as a good-natured, if slow-witted teen traveling through time in "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989), which led to a slew of roles as goofy but earnest young men in Ron Howard's "Parenthood" (1989) and the Lawrence Kasden-penned "I Love You To Death" (1990).</p>
